# Simulation of COVID Spreading
## ID1110-Introduction to Programming
Animating covid simulation and plotting the graphs based on a specific set of points.The graph includes factors affecting epidemic spread such as social distance,vaccination and travel rate.The aim of the project is to observe the spread and to analyse the plots when there are changes in various factors included.We will find which factor is most helpful to reduce the disease and compare about the scope on various factors

  ## Our roadmap

## Description of epidemic spread
Though the name is given as 'covid', this is applicable for various epidemics spread if we vary the viral fatality rate. For such a pandemic virus, the spread patterns must be closely observed.It's not spread line by line. It's not one to one process. We cant interpret that if A gets infected next is B afterward C likewise. The spread is even more rapid such that if one person gets infected, a huge number of people around him are at high risk of infection. This is why we chose a circle in our animation so that we can represent the same easily. When it comes to the second programme it is important to note how various factors are affecting the viral spread. If no factor is introduced, since we aren't giving any control on the epidemic, obviously the virus should undergo rapid spread and a maximum number of people must get infected. But if preventive measures are taken, this spread must gradually decrease and reach a minimum.

## FINDINGS FROM PLOTS
###  What if you don't give any control

### Travel restriction alone won't solve the problem

### Travel rate will help with a partner

### Vaccination works more than social Distancing
